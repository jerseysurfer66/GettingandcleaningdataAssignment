# Getting and Cleaning Data Coursera - Project #
**This project takes the data sets from the Human Activity Recognition Using Smartphones repository and performs 5 actions on it.**

1. Reads data in from the train, test, and subject sets and merges them appropriately.
2. Extracts the means and standard deviations from each. 
3. Assigns activity names to appropriate columns
4. Assigns labels to variables
5. Tidy's up the dataset for analysis in R. 

** This script assumes you're working directory in R is the folder containing the datasets and that you have the dplyr library installed.
